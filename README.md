NPM

package.json file is a configuration for npm. It keeps a track what version of package is installed in the system. if ^ carat it means install upgrade version if there is minor change in version  and ~tidel means top version.â€¨[^ caret checks minor changes in verson].  [~ tilder checks major changes]	package.lock.json file keeps the track of exact version of all the dependencies.
we need package.json because it takes care of all registry their version and other aspects.	
bundlers: bundles your app properly for production because we need our whole code to be clean, neat before it cabe send for production. Some bundlers  like [ Webpack ,Parcel , VEET ] 
	
>>> gitIgnore ignores files that we mention we put node modules in it.
>>>>> Why we need to put both files on git because I can recreate node modules with these package.json and package.lock.json

There are 2 types types of packages
1. Dev dependency : it means it is generally req for development phase
2. Normal dependency: it is used in production also

Node Modules are collection of dependencies.

Transitive Dependency : means dependency is depend on another dependency . Another dependency is depend on other dependencies and go on dependency tree. 
E.g, parcel >> another dependency >> depends on another dependency >> and so on dependency tree.
